## How to set up

- This project was bootstrapped with the create-react-app library.
- `yarn install` installs the packages and `yarn start` runs the app.

## What this is about

- A practice project for me to learn how to integrate Typescript into a React + Redux app.
- This app uses a dummy API that fetches a list of todos. Clicking on a todo removes it from the list.
